## 🚀 About Me

I'm passionate about FOSS, physical and mental wellbeing, and creating a sense of community in all environments. Outside of work I do a wide range of activities other than development. Bouldering 🧗, reading 📚, Muay Thai 🥋, motorcyles 🏍️, hiking 🥾, and horticulture 🌵 are just a few of my hobbies! 

By day I work as a consultant at [Mantel Group](https://mantelgroup.com.au/), where I break down business problems and craft solutions using a wide range of technologies in a cloud-first approach.

By night I'm an avid developer working on a range of open-source projects. Continue reading to get an idea of what I'm currently working on.
